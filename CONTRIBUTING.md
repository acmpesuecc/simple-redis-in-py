# Participant: How to Contribute

1. **Check for Open Issues**:
   Look for any open issues in the repository. If you find one that interests you, ask to be assigned to it by commenting on the issue. Please do not work on an issue that has not been assigned to you.

2. **Setup Your Codebase**:
   - **Fork** the repository to your GitHub account and copy it's clone URL
   - **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine using [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git) (make sure it's installed)

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your-username/simple-redis-in-py.git
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**
   After cloning and setting up *your* branch, make the necessary changes to the code in your IDE.
   (Warning: your changes would not be considered if they are directly made on main/master branch).
   Feel free to ask your doubts in the comments or reach out to the repo owner.
   

4. **Commit and Push**:
   Commit your changes and push them to your fork:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe the changes you made"
   git push
   ```

   Alternatively, use VSCode's inbuilt Git source control pane `Ctrl+Shift+G` if you're unconfortable with a CLI

5. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   After pushing your changes, open a pull request to pull changes from your fork to the original repository. 

6. **Get Feedback**
   Wait for a maintainer to review your pull request (PR) and provide feedback.

7. **Gain Bounty Points**
   If everything is approved, your issue will be closed, and you'll gain bounty points on the leaderboard!
